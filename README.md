# Code Quiz
This was the fourth homework assignment from the MSU Coding Boot Camp. The assignment required me to build a timed JavaScript themed quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application is supposed to run within the browser and be created using dynamic JavaScript.

## Requirements (What it *Should* Do)
* When the start button is clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* After a question is answered, it disappears and another question appears it its place.
* If a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock.
* Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.
* When the game is over then the user can save their initials and score.

## What’s Going On With *MY* Application
Per usual, I made this assignment far more complicated than it needed to be. During the planning stages I had the thought of using arrays, but didn't really know how to go about doing so. Instead of looking deeper into this, I went a different way. I wish I hadn't, but I told myself that I would complete this assignment without any help from anyone else. That may have been my downfall. Without anyone else's input I didn't have anything to compare my code to. It wasn't until working with my tutor that I had my suspicions confirmed - I did this all wrong. He was kind enough to give me a clue as to how this could have been coded more elegantly. However at that point I had less than 24 hours to complete this assignment. I decided it would be better to try to make what I had work, than to scrap the entire thing and start over. It would’ve taken me too long to start over and do it right.

Despite this clunky appearance of my code it is mostly functional and it does meet most of the requirements. I couldn't figure out the local storage - saving the users score and user input initials and posting it to the high score section. Maybe if I had had more time I could've done so - or just redone the entire thing so that it would be less chaotic. In the future I hope to have time to rewrite this monstrosity.
