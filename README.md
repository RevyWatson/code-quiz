# Code Quiz
Coding quiz application designed to test users knowledge of basic JavaScript. The application runs within the browser. Built using dynamic HTML and CSS styling and powered by JavaScript.

## Acceptance Criteria
* When the start button is clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* After a question is answered, it disappears and another question appears it its place.
* If a question is answered incorrectly time is subtracted from the clock.
* Once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.
* When the game is over then the user can save their initials and score.

## Future Developement
I recogize that there is a much simpler and far more elegant way of coding this application. In the future I'd like to rebuild this project with those concepts in mind. Currently the local storage isn't functional and the user cannot log their initials to the high score section. Those missing elements are definitely things that I'd like to correct and implement in the future version of this application.
